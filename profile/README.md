## Why you would want to use E-FileTypes

- **Cloud Storage**: Storing important files on the cloud today can be a scary and even risky thing to do. For people who store media, games, or music, of which they may not own, providers have been known to take such files off their platforms without giving a notice beforehand. With E-FileTypes you can store your files, encrypted and safe without worry.
- **Shared Computer**: If you share a family computer, a computer with your loved ones, or even use a public computer, you may want to store important files which you don't want anyone to access. There are many ways of hiding folders, or locking them with Bitdefender on Windows, but they aren't as secure as they could be.
- **Transportation**: Sharing files online with specific people can be a difficult task. Some people zip up folders and lock those, or lock a link using a service like Mega. While these can work well at times, you still don't get a guarantee of end-to-end encryption with the transfer of said files. With E-FileTypes you can encrypt a file beforehand with a password and makesure that any man in the middle can't do anything with your files.
- **Use in applications**: With a Python module, and more to come (Javascript, Java, Rust, and even C) you can use E-FileTypes in any application that you build, ensuring your customers' files are safe and secure.
- **Peace of mind**: With E-FileTypes, you can be sure that your files that you locked will never be able to be decrypted without your authorization.
- **Ease of use**: E-FileTypes includes a [client](https://github.com/E-FileTypes/client-app) that you can use on any major desktop OS. This provides easy access to encrypted files on any device.
